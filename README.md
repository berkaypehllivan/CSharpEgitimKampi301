# C# BOOTCAMP SECTION 301
**This repository is based on C# Bootcamp published by Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ on Youtube and is a continuation of the previous 101-201 repository. You can browse the details covered in each section from the bottom.**

## ðŸ“Œ Episode 11: Module OOP: N Architecture Entity Layer with C#
In the beginning of the chapter 301, we started by creating a new solution. Created Entity, DataAccess, Business and Presentation/UI layers that we will use in our projects. We created a folder called Concrete for the EntityLayer class. This Contrete usually contains concrete, that is, classes. We created tables over C# without using SQL and this process is called Code First. Normally a database table created on SQL is transferred to C# via query, while in this method a class is created (the name of the class must be the name of the table) and this created class is transferred to SQL as a table. The properties created in the class represent the columns. BusinessLayer, DataAccessLayer, EntityLayer and PresentationLayer are created and a solution is prepared for the next lesson.

**Notes**

**Access Modifiers:** 1-) Public: Accessible from all the classes under solution. 2-) Private: Accessible from only its own class. 3-) Internal: Accessible only from the layer it's in. 4-) Protected: Accessible only from classes that inherited class.

**Field - Variable - Property:** 1-) Field: Variables defined directly in the class. 2-) Variable: Variables that are defined not directly in the class but, in a method in the class. 3-) Property: When the variable structure receives get; set; values at the end, it becomes property. If you want to read the value of this variable, GET method works. If you want to assign a value of the variable, SET method works.

**Code First:** In the Code First approach, name of the class must be the same and Id must be written at the en in order to recognise that the ID value is the primary key and auto-incrementing. (CategoryId, ProductId etc.)

## ðŸ“Œ Episode 12: Module OOP: Data Access Layer and Context Class
Each product must have a category. A propertly named CategoryId was created for the class in the project and an object named Category was created from the Category Class as 'public virtual Category Category{get; set;}' in order to access the values in the Category table through the product. We also need to inform the Category table from the Product class. 'public List<Product> Products{get; set;}' property was created in Category Class. The reason why the products object in the Category class is created as plural and the Category object in the Product class is created as singular is that while any product can have only one category, there can be more than one product in a category. This format is called a one-to-many relationships were established in the same way. There must be a product and a customer in the order. Therefore, ProductId,Product object from Product class, CustomerId and Customer object from Customer class are defined as properties in Order class.
